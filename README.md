## Concepts 

Obsidian graph view is good but lack organization. When you have too many notes, it is difficult to see your note. It is a must for you to complex query to find the specific notes. However, obsidian's internal graph plugin does not allow you to store graph options. You need to build and same your graph options somewhere and copy and paste your options every time. 

Also, obsidan graph view show nodes and edges based on links. However, obsidian edge has no attributes. You cannot see the relation between nodes simply on the graph. The graph also show no structure because bascially the notes are just scattered out on the canvas. 

This plugin provide a solution : 

1. save graph options 
2. introduce structure using clusters
    1. create (propagate)
    2. merge 
    3. split
3. ... 

### Note ‚ö†Ô∏è

Although you can use this plugin however you like, but the original idea of plugin is opinionated about how you should structure your notes.
